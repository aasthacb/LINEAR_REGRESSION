#Project Statement
Below you will find attached a dataset of the healthcare costs for patients. The columns represent the AGE, GENDER (here termed as female or not), LOS (length of stay in the hospital), RACE (the patient's ethnicity), TOTCHG (healthcare cost) and APRDRG (which is a classfication of patients on the basis of reason of admission, severity of illness and risk of mortality)

Implement a linear regression model on the attached dataset to predict the total healthcare cost (TOTCHG) for patients given the other parameters.
